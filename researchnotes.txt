Introduction:
	Text to SQL is a challenge for both Natural Language Modeling and Database Communities
	Previous works focused on extracting question to SQL patterns and training them with a Text to SQL corpus
	Recently, Large Language Models (aka LLMs) have become the new leader in text to SQL
	The **biggest challenge with text to SQL is correctly prompting LLMs to generate SQL queries**
Preliminary:
	Text to SQL allows for non-expert users to use database systems
	To tackle text-to-SQL, the core is to find the **optimal** prompt
	Prompt Engineering is classified into two scenarios:
		Zero-shot, which the main challenge is to represent the natural language question effectively, including adding relevant information such as the database schema
		Few-shot, which focuses not only on question representation, but also how to select the most helpful examples and organize them in the prompt
	In context learning enables LLMs to identify explicit or inexplicit patterns from the input prompt, allowing LLMs to be capable of new tasks during inference without any specific training
	LLMs can have their performance enchanted by Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT)
		SFTs have been used before to avoid offensive responses, biases, and hallucinations
	To summarize, optimal prompt engineering, in context learning, and supervised fine tuning are the three essential knobs in the text to SQL LLM

Methodology
	A new text to SQL prompt engineering method, named DAIL-SQL, refreshes the best performance with 68.8% accuracy
	There are 5 representation methods:
		1. Basic Prompt, consists of table schemas, natural language prefixed by 'Q:' and a response prefixed by "A:Select" to prompt LLMs to generate SQL
		2. Text Representation Prompt, represents both schema and question in natural language. Compared to the basic prompt, it adds instruction at the very beginning to guide LLMs
		3. Open AI Demonstration Prompt consists of instruction, table schemas, and questions where all information are commented by the pound sign.
		4. Code Representation Prompt presents Text-to-SQL task in SQL syntax, directly presenting "CREATE TABLE" queries, and prompts LLM with natural language question in comments. Stands out to its ability to provide information necessary for database creation, with 75.6% accuracy
		5. Alpaca SFT Prompt is designed for supervised fine-tuning, prompting LLM to follow instruction and finish tasks according to the input context in Markdown format
		Above Representations enable LLMs to output SQLs by zero-shot learning
		However, text-to-SQL performs better with in-context learning
	 In Text to SQL, the goal is to maximize the probability that the LLM generates a correct query by choosing right examples and presenting them effectively to the model
	There are several strategies to selecting good examples:
		1. Random. which randomly samples from available candidates
		2. Question Similarity Selection chooses examples with most similar questions, embedding both example and target questions with a pre-trained language mode, then applying a predefined distance measure (such as Euclidian distance or negative cosine similarity), then an algorithm is used to select examples that closely match the target question
		3. Masked Question Similarity Selection eliminates the negative influence of domain-specific information by replacing table, column and value names in all questions with a mask token, then computing similarities with an algorithm
		4. Query Similarity Selection uses examples similar to the target SQL query instead of the target question. It uses a model to generate an SQL query using a target 
	These strategies focus on selecting examples using **only target questions and queries** which does not take into account the importance of in-context learning
	Therefore, example organization is important in determining what information of the above examples will be organized into the prompt
		1. Full Information Organization organizes examples in the same representation with the target question- examples are structured identically to the target, only differences being instead of *SELECT* being at the end, there are examples after *SELECT*
		2. SQL-Only Organization includes only SQL Queries of the selected examples with a prefix instruction in the prompt, and removes mapping information between questions and corresponding SQL queries

   DAIL SQL
	   To address the issues in example selection, DAIL-SQL is used
	   DAIL Selection considers both questions and queries to select candidates- specifically, DAIL selection masks specific words in the target question and example question, then ranks the examples based on the Euclidian distance between embeddings of the masked words
	   DAIL also simultaneously calculates query similarity between pre-predicted SQL queries and prioritizes sorted candidates by question similarity, allowing for the top examples to have good similarity to the question and query 
	   DAIL Organization can preserve the mapping information between questions and SQL queries and also improve token efficiency, being a compromise between Full Information Organization and SQL-Only Organization by reserving question-SQL mapping and removing token-cost database schema to reduce example token length
	  DAIL-SQL adopts Code Representation Prompts as its question representation, as compared with other representations, Code Representation contains full information of the database, including keys which aids LLM prediction (particularly JOIN clauses)
	  To summarize, DAIL-SQL uses Code Representation and selects examples based on information from both questions and queries and organizes them to keep question to SQL mappings

SUPERVISED FINE TUNING
	To enhance the performance of LLMs in zero-shot, supervised fine tuning offers an alternative option to in-context learning
	LLMs can be fine tuned using generated data from target questions and the given database, and the actual expected and desired response from the LLM

Experiments- Setting
	Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated on two recognized datasets- Spider and Spider Realistic
	Spider is a cross domain text-to-SQL dataset, containing 8659 instances in training split and 1035 instances in development split over 200 databases
	Spider-Realistic is a more challenging variant of Spider, selecting a subset of 508 examples from Spider and manually revises questions while keeping SQL queries unchanged
